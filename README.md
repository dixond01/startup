## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

For single BYU students, FHE is usually fun activities, not peer Gospel study. There is little motivation to do _Come, Follow Me_ because there's no one to share what you learn with. InspireUS fills that need. InspireUS is a peer collaboration app that opens a new discussion each week based on that week's _Come, Follow Me_. It allows users to start threads about specific scriptures and share the insights they've learned in real time. InspireUS encourages scripture study and spiritual conversations all week!
